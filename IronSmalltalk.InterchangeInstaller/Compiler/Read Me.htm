            IronSmalltalk Interchange Services</h1>
        <p>
            This namespace contains classes that contain the business logic described in 
            X3J20 chapter <em>4. Smalltalk Interchange Format</em>.</p>
        <p>
            The services in this namespace contain the functionality to process (and
            <span class="style1">file-in</span>) Smalltak Interchange File (normally known 
            as .st files). </p>
        <p>
            The main component is the <strong>InterchangeFormatProcessor</strong>, which 
            processes a single source file according to the X3J20 definitions. It determines 
            from the source file the version of the interchange file. It uses the given
            <span class="style1">map</span> to determine which <strong>
            InterchangeVersionService</strong> to use to process this file. The 
            InterchangeVersionService is the object that knows how to interpret the contents 
            of the source file. Currently only <strong>InterchangeVersionService10</strong> 
            is implemented, since we only support pure X3J20 definitions. IronSmalltalk may 
            implement an extended service. </p>
        <p>
            The InterchangeFormatProcessor converts the source code to parse nodes, which 
            create <span class="style1">definition objects</span> for the corresponding 
            source code. The definition objects inherit from <strong>
            IronSmalltalk.Runtime.Installer.Definitions.DefinitionBase</strong> and 
            contain the information found in the source code. It is however possible to 
            create those entirely from code without having source file.</p>
        <p>
            The InterchangeFormatProcessor notifies an <strong>IInterchangeFileInProcessor
            </strong>for each element that it reads from the source file giving it the 
            corresponding definition object. It is up to the IInterchangeFileInProcessor to 
            evaluate it immediately or deffer the processing for later or perform 
            transactional processing.</p>
        <p>
            Note: To sum things up; classes here don&#39;t exactly know what to do with the code 
            that is being filed-in. They pass the information to the 
            IInterchangeFileInProcessor and let it do the work.</p>

            folder.</p>
