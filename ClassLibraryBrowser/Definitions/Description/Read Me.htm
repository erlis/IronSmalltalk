            The <strong>IronSmalltalk.Tools.ClassLibraryBrowser.Definitions</strong> 
            namespace contains classes representing the .Net model for the <strong><em>
            Standard 
            Smtalltalk Class Library</em></strong> described in the X3J20 documentation 
            chapter 5. </p>
        <p>
            The <strong><em>Standard Class Library</em></strong> describes only the 
            conceptual externaly visible behavior of the Smalltalk system in form of 
            protocols. Therefore classes in the <strong>Definitions</strong> namespace only 
            describe the protocols defined in the X3J20 document. </p>
        <p>
            The definition objects are derived from the X3J20 documentation and should 
            therefore generally be treated as <strong><em>read-only</em></strong>. It is 
            possible to edit them, but this should only be done to correct errors during 
            conversion/entry from the X3J20 documentation. It is also possible (and 
            encouradged) to create additional protocols.</p>
        <p>
            Exception to the <strong><em>read-only</em></strong> rule are method 
            declarations. Those were extended with a source field, where a source code can 
            be entered for later reuse when the protocols are to be implemented in concrete 
            implementation.</p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            Objects in the <strong>Definitions</strong> namespace can serialize to XML and 
            materialize from XML. The XML is defined in the <strong>SystemDescription.xsd</strong> 
            in the <strong>External</strong> folder. XML must adhere to the strict XSD 
            specification. The <strong><em>root</em></strong> object is <strong>SystemDescription</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            The <strong>IronSmalltalk.Tools.ClassLibraryBrowser.RuntimeDefinitions</strong> 
            namespace is where the concrete implementation is defined.</p>
